This project implements a serverless solution for mass mailing using various AWS services. The key services include:
Amazon S3: Utilized for efficient storage of email content and recipient lists.
AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM): Configured to securely manage user permissions and access controls, ensuring proper authentication.
AWS Lambda: Powers the serverless execution of the email sending logic, enabling scalable and efficient email dispatch without the need for server management.
Amazon Simple Email Service (SES): Handles the actual sending of emails, offering a reliable and scalable solution for managing sender and recipient email addresses.

This project demonstrates the capabilities of serverless architecture in automating mass email workflows while leveraging the flexibility and scalability of AWS.
Tech Stack: Python 3.9, AWS Lambda, S3, SES, IAM 2024
